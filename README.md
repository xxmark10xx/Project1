<!-- Game Description -->

sticks is a game that I played when I was younger. it consists of two players. To start the game both player need to use both hands and stickk out there pointer 
fingers. The role of the fingers it to be markers. When player one starts they use their pointer finger to hit player two finger and then player two put up another finger on the hand that was hit. Then player two can choose between hit player one with the two finger on one hand or the one finger on the other. If player two hits player one with the two fingers they have up then player one has to add two fingers to the hand that got hit.
